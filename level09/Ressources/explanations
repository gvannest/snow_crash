1. ./level09 token => tpmhr
	./level09 test => tfuw
	echo coucou > test	
	./level09 `cat test` => cpwfsz

	We notice that the level09 executable change the string passed as parameter. It actually change it by increasing the ascii character by its index in the string 


2. cat token => f4kmm6p|=�p�n��DB�Du{��
   it seems like the resut of a string passed to the level09 exec.

3. So we built a script which would reverse the effect of the level09 program, by decreasing the ascii character of the string 

4. python reverse.py `cat token`
