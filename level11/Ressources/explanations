1. cat level11.lua

2. At first we noticed the hash which when decrypted gives "NotSoEasy" :)

3 the hash function executes a function via io.popen : "echo "..pass.." | sha1sum"
Hence if we manage to give a pass input which will be exectued in this command, it could give us the flag!

4. We connect to the listening port 5151 : > nc 127.0.0.1 5151 

5. The prompt asks us for a password: `getflag > /tmp/test`

6. cat /tmp/test => the flag!
