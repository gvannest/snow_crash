1. ll -> level06 executable. When we execute it alone, there is an error message saying : "file_get_contents(): Filename cannot be empty in /home/user/level06/level06.php on line 4"

2. So we look into the php file and see that the argument 1 is passed onto the x function, then its content is retreived (so must be a file) and finally its content goes through multiple regex.

3. in the first regex, there is an e flag which means it will execute the second argument of the preg_replace function, as php code. This second argument actually calls the y function on the 2nd part of the matching regex. y function does not execute anything so we have to make sure the 2nd match is actually executed / evaluated when the call to y happens.

4. the system function is a php function which execute an external program and display its result.

5. Hence by passing on {${system(getflag)}} to the function call, the system(getflag) will be called, and its result pass on to the y function.

6. hence: "[x {${system(getflag)}}]" is a string that will match the regex, and with the second part being what we want to be executed

7. echo "'[x {${system(getflag)}}]'" > /tmp/flag06
8. ./level06 /tmp/flag06
