1. ./level07 => displays "level07"

2. gdb ./level07 
	disas main or info functions => it calls getenv

3. quit gdb. check env variable with "env" : we have several variables with level07 : USER, LOGNAME...

4. Changing LOGNAME with "export LOGNAME=coucou", we see that this one is printed

5. export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
