1. we try ./level08 token => You may not access token 

2. when lloking into the functions with a 'strings level08', we see that they use the 'strstr' function from libC

3. Disassembling the main with gdb, we see that they apply strstr and then test if they found a substr.

4. In 'strings level08', we see the word 'token' before the string 'You may not access token'. So we tried to change the name of the file to 'coucou' and launch './level08 coucou'

5. on a le token : quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

6. su flag08 with the above mentioned password

7. getflag :)
