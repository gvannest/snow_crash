The binary level10 has a the following usage
./level10 file host
	sends file to host if you have access to it

Unfortunately we don't have acces to the file token, which is the same size as the other flag.

Sending another file, we got another message error:
Connecting to 127.0.0.1:6969 .. Unable to connect to host 127.0.0.1

We realise that no service were listening on port 6969 (netstat -a).

We use the command "nc -lk 6969" to listen to this port.

The binary sends the file content to the port 6969.
But we still didn't have acces to it.

We checked all the functions called (nm / strings) and read the man.

Access presents some security problem: concurential access.
